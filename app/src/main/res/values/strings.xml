        a way to share my creativity to others through the course I am pursuing right now. Some might say that I am different.
        That I am weak in this field and I will not survive. At first, I couldn’t agree more on what they are saying but at
        the end I know that I am on the right track. For me, it is by our own way on how we will choose to survive every
